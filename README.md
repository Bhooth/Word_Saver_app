This is my first flutter app. It takes word and its meaning as inputs from the user and saves it to shared preferences. it is printed in a different page.
I tried using Databases as they have many more funcionalities but I got errors and couldn't successfully make it.
This is why I chose shared preference to save my words. Hoping to create better apps in the future.
